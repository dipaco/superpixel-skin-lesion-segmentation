Superpixel-skin-lesion-segmentation
===================

This repository contains the necesary code to reproduce the results of the paper [Automatic Skin Lesion Segmentation on Dermoscopic Images by the Means of Superpixel Merging](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00937-3_83) presented in the conference MICCAI 2018. 

To run the code simply switch to the adequate paths to the PH2 or ISIC dataset inside main.py, and then type:

```bash
python main.py
```
